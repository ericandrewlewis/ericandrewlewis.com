        <p>Hi there. I hope you are doing okay during the staying in. Things are a bit undetermined right now. I've had a ton of trouble keeping it together these last two weeks myself. It is completely normal if you are too.</p>
        <p>On this site I will write about my experiences to help myself process, but also to help you process. We are going to get through this together. Keeping track of how we feel and what we're going through is important work right now.</p>
        <p>The content will probably be critical reflection. It will range in tone between neutral and uplifting. I will not be writing about Coronavirus itself or the problems it is creating in our society. There is enough of that content on other websites.</p>
        <p>I'll post more here soon. Since you probably won't check my website every day, I'm going to figure out a way to let you know when I write more.</p>
        <p>Let me know if you want me to send you a note when I have updates here. I'll respect the amount of notifications and information coming your way that you do not need.</p>
